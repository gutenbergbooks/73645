PREFACE<br>
</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> point of view from which this manual was written is
indicated in the introduction.</p>

<p>The aims are to increase efficiency in the farm home and to
satisfy the growing demand for useful information in the country
schools.</p>

<p>This is done by giving suggestions and directions for practical
work to be done in the home and at school.</p>

<p>Throughout the country to-day many rural schools are expressing
a desire to add to their present school curricula courses
which are practical. The ideal kept in mind during the preparation
of this manual has been to supply that need and at the same
time to make it possible for any woman to use the book in her
own home.</p>

<p>The limitations in the size have caused many omissions. It
is the intention of the author to enlarge upon this material as
the demand increases. Ideas and suggestions from other States
have been dominant throughout, thus carrying out the true demonstration
point of view.</p>

INTRODUCTION<br>
</h3>
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">By President Julian A. Burruss</span><br>
<span class="smaller">State Normal School for Women, Harrisonburg, Va.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">No</span> phase of modern social development has received more
attention in recent years than that of our rural population.
Advances have been striking along all lines of country life. It
would, however, be too much to say that the interests of women
and their work in the home have received the attention properly
due them. Frequently farmers of the highest type will equip
their farms with the latest and best implements and machinery
for their work and yet will fail to provide their homes with
equipment equally as essential and desirable for the work of
the women members of their households. Women’s organizations
and the agents of the Home Demonstration Work, together
with other agencies, have done much to direct attention along
this very important line and in many communities labor-saving
devices of a most ingenious character have been developed.</p>

<p>What is good for one busy housewife is not too good for
another, and it is a good rule to push a good thing along for
the benefit of others. With this in view the author has gathered
together numerous inventions of home-made devices of a labor-saving
and efficiency-increasing kind, and describes them in this
little volume so that all to whom it may come may have the
opportunity to make such contrivances, or modifications of them,
for their own use. In doing this, the author has not merely
had in her mind her own State, but has sought to recognize the
viewpoints of women in as many other States as possible.</p>

<p>The author is peculiarly fitted for the task she has set herself.
As Assistant State Agent for Home Demonstration Work in
Virginia, under the direction of the United States Department of
Agriculture, and as supervisor and community worker for a
number of years in various rural districts before assuming the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
duties of her present position, she has had abundant facilities
for becoming familiar with the conditions prevailing in country
homes. Having maintained sympathetic relationships with country
women for many years, she knows their problems and their
needs, and she is also familiar with the sources from which help
may be drawn.</p>

<p>There can be no real improvement in social life in the country
unless there is leisure time to be devoted to uplifting, cultural,
and recreational purposes. The only way in which this may
be obtained is by means of labor-saving and time-saving appliances.
The articles here described are intensely practical and
may be readily made in any home at a nominal cost. To make
two blades of grass grow where one formerly grew is certainly
a very valuable achievement; but to save muscles and nerves,
and to give time and energy for mental and social and spiritual
development, is far more valuable and desirable. If the information
given in this book serves to lighten the burden and shorten
the daily drudgery of a single housewife, its publication will be
justified; and it should find a cordial reception in a multitude
of homes.

VEGETABLE PARING TABLE<br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">A convenient kitchen table made of poplar and covered with
zinc with an opening in the center through which the parings of
vegetables or the scraping of dishes may be put into a pail sitting
on the lower shelf. This saves soiling the floor and many steps
while preparing the vegetables for cooking. It should be remembered
that the pail underneath must be removed and the contents
emptied into the garbage barrel after each using. It is not a
garbage pail and should in no sense be used as such. Above the
table hooks on which hang many smaller cooking utensils, such
as paring knives, graters, spoons, scissors, or can openers, are
all arranged to accommodate the housekeeper.</p>

JELLY STRAINER NO. 1<br>

<p>An old chair is generally used to hang the jelly bag over
while the juice is dripping. As a substitute the device shown
in the following illustration is suggested as being more convenient
and sanitary in every way. It not only provides a place
for the bag to hang, but it also has a shelf on which the pan sits
to catch the drippings from the bag. The legs are adjustable;
hence it is easily taken apart and kept in a small space. This
makes the strainer especially convenient to the Canning Club
Agent as she goes her daily rounds teaching the housekeepers the
art of jelly-making. It can be easily made at home and at a
little cost.</p>

DISH DRAINER<br>
</p>
</div><!--end chapter head-->

<p>The work of dish-washing is greatly reduced by the use of a
dish drainer. The dishes are carefully washed and arranged in
the drainer, and boiling water poured over them. When they
are dry, they can be put away or allowed to stand with a clean
cloth thrown over them until ready to use.</p>

<p>This dish drainer resembles a box in shape, put on legs, with
slats placed inside at equal distances apart, making the compartments
to hold the dishes. The space in front is made a little
larger to accommodate the irregular dishes. An experienced
housewife will know that glassware and silverware cannot be
dried by this method. A hole is made in one corner of the
drainer through which the water drains off into a pail which is
kept under the corner.</p>

<div class="p2 small">
<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Materials</span>:</p>

<ul><li>16’ of white pine.</li>

<li>4½’ of sheet zinc to cover the inside of drainer.</li>
<li>4” of half-galvanized pipe for drainage tube.</li>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Directions</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="unindent">Make a pine box which is 8” deep and 24” × 26” long. The joints must
be laid in white lead in order to make the drainer water tight. Nail 2
slats ¼” thick × 1” wide × 24” long down flat from the front to the
back of the box at the outer edge. These are used as supports for the
other crosswise slats and also allow the water to run under the slats.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Nail 4 slats on these supports, beginning 3¼” from the back of the box
and making a distance of 3¼” between each slat. This will leave a 9”
space in front of the box for the irregular dishes. The front legs are
made of the four pieces 1” thick × 4” wide × 35” long, and the back
legs are 1” thick × 4” wide × 36” deep. This slant provides for the
drainage. The drainer should be tipped a little to the corner in which
the drain pipe is placed. If zinc is to be used for lining, it must be done
before the slats are put into the box.</p>

division from the coal bin is put in. Measure 9” from the back of the
coal box and put the straight partition (1” × 21” × 1’ 11½”) in by nailing
it to the bottom and sides of the coal box. Then the slanting partition
(1” × 2’ 2” × 1’ 11½”) is nailed to the bottom and front edge of the
box as shown in the illustration. Cut an opening (9” × 1’ 11½”) in the top
(1” × 1’ 9¾” × 2’ 1½”) and then nail top on the box, using the piece which
is cut out for the door to the opening. Hinge this piece on with one pair
of 1½” (butt) hinges. The door support (½” × ½” × 1’ 11½”) is
nailed on the inside of the back of the box. Bevel the piece (1” × 1’ 7”
× 2’ 1½”) for the slanting door. It must fit each edge as shown in the
illustration. Hinge this door at the upper edge of the top with one pair
of 1½” (butt) hinges. One screen door handle is put on each opening to
lift them. The four castors are placed on the bottom of each corner of
the box to make it more easily moved about. Stain or paint the coal box.</p>

</ul>
</div><!--end small font-->

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Directions</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="unindent">The frame consists of four wooden posts (1¼” × 1¼” × 23”); four
side pieces (1¼” × 1¼” × 21”); two front pieces (1¼” × 1¼” × 11”);
and two back pieces (1¼” × 1¼” × 11”). To the posts are lightly
nailed on each side six strips (1” × 2¼” × 23½”). These pieces serve
as supports for the drying racks. The corners are notched out as indicated
in the drawing to allow the strips to extend out to the outer wall
of the drier.</p>

<p class="unindent">For each side use a sheet of light weight sheet steel (23½” × 23”); for
the back a sheet (13½” × 23”); for the top a sheet (13½” × 23½”).
In the top piece an opening about 3” × 10” is cut about four inches from
the back edge to permit the escape of moist air. It may be found at
times that this ventilating opening is too large. Then it may be partially
closed by placing over it a tin pan or other vessel.</p>

<p class="unindent">For the bottom a sheet 13½” × 23½” is used. This sheet is thoroughly
perforated with holes to admit the warm air. Another piece of sheet
steel (A on the drawing) (7½” × 17½”) is provided to make the heat
spread more evenly. This piece rests on wires above the bottom of the
drier. These wires are put through small holes punched in the side
sheets (see B on drawing).</p>

<p class="unindent">The door is made of heavier gauge sheet steel (13½” × 23”).</p>

<p class="unindent">The legs are made of four pieces of sheet steel bent on an angle as indicated
in the drawing.

<p class="unindent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
All the sheet steel parts may be tacked on the frame but the door, which is
secured by hinges.</p>

<p class="unindent">The frames of the six trays are made of ¾” wood 10½” wide and 20½” long.</p>

<p class="unindent">Make the bottom of the trays of wire cloth (20½” × 10½”). This is
tacked on the underside of the frame of the trays.</p>
</div>

<p>By referring to the drawing it will be observed that the bottom
tray is shoved back as far as it will go; the next tray above is
pulled as far front as the door will admit; the next tray is shoved
back and so on with each tray shoving one to the back and pulling
the other to the front. The object of this arrangement is to allow
the heat to pass over and around the ends which causes a more
rapid movement of the air current. This is more important in
drying than the heat.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to shift the trays by putting the top one on
the bottom and the bottom one on the top during the drying process
so as to dry the products more uniformly.</p>

</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p>What an unsightly spectacle does a wood pile by the stove,
on the porch, or in the corner of the room present! It is a place
of refuge for all trash, such as old papers and rags. This not
only adds to the untidiness of the room or porch, but it makes
extra work for the already overworked woman. The wood box
made of old dry goods boxes should appeal strongly to the home.
It can be kept by the stove or on the porch or in some convenient
place to be reached, and to be filled by the man before he goes to
his daily work. A lid will not only cover up the contents of the
box, but it will serve as a comfortable seat to be used while
preparing the meal.</p>

FIRELESS COOKER<br>
</p>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p>There are many advantages in having a fireless cooker in the
home. It not only saves time and fuel but keeps the woman from
standing over the hot fire, and there are many foods that are
better when cooked at a lower temperature. The principle of
the fireless cooker is to retain the heat by boiling the food in a
vessel with a tight cover and placing it in the cooker in the same
vessel, thus keeping the heat from escaping. An outside container
may be made to accommodate one or more cooking vessels.
A cheap but efficient fireless cooker may be made of a tightly built
wooden box, a barrel, or a tin lard can as shown in the illustration.
If the outside container is of wood it must be lined on the inside
with asbestos or heavy paper to keep out the air.</p>

<p>The nest may be a galvanized or tin bucket of a size which
will admit of three inches of packing between the outside container
and the nest. The sides and bottom of the nest are covered
with asbestos to prevent the scorching or the burning of the
packing.</p>

<p>The packing must be of some material through which the heat
cannot easily escape. Cork, sawdust, excelsior, hay, or shredded
newspaper may be used to an advantage. Three inches of this
packing is put tightly in the bottom of the outside container and
around the sides to fill in the space between the outside container
and the nest.</p>

<p>A four-inch space is left at the top of the fireless cooker in
which a cushion made of unbleached cotton or some other material
is stuffed with the packing and placed to make the cooker
air-tight. Cut two circles out of the unbleached cotton and a
three-inch straight piece to join the circles together. A hot soapstone,
stove plate or brick is placed in the bottom of the nest before
the food vessel is placed in the fireless cooker. The food vessel
may be any cooking utensil with a top that will fit in the nest
after the soapstone has been put in. Cut a circle of tin or cardboard
to fit top of inside of cooker with an opening the size of
the nest. This gives a good finish to the top of the fireless cooker
and preserves the packing.</p>

ICELESS REFRIGERATOR NO. 1<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Country homes without ice houses and too far from town to
have access to manufactured ice may have an iceless refrigerator
as a good substitute. This convenience comprises a simple wooden
frame with a covering of canton flannel, burlap, Indian-head
cloth or linen crash made to fit so that little air is admitted into it.
Wicks made of the same material as the cover are tacked on top
of each side of the cover and extend over into the pan of water
sitting on top of the frame. This water is taken up by the wicks
and carried down on the sides of the cover by capillary attraction
when evaporation takes place, drawing the heat from the inside
and lowering the temperature. The more rapid the evaporation,
the lower the temperature. Tests have shown that if the refrigerator
is kept in a place where the air circulates around it freely,
a temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit may be obtained.</p>

<div class="p2 small">
<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Materials</span>:</p>


<ul><li>40’ of white pine.</li>

<span class="smcap">Directions</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="unindent">Make the frame 3½’ high with twelve crosspieces tacked to the four posts,
nailing the first 4 strips 9” from the bottom of the frame, and the
remaining 8 strips about 11” apart. An 18½” square frame is made of
wood and nailed on top of the posts. The corners of this square are
mitered or lapped over and tacked together. Use a biscuit pan to fit in
top of the square to hold the water. The whole refrigerator should
stand in a larger pan which catches the drippings from the cover and
keeps away the insects. The screen door is made 39” long × 16” wide,
which is joined to the frame with hinges and fastens with a hook. Three
movable shelves with perforations in them are made of zinc. Cover the
whole frame with wire screening to protect it from the flies. When the
frame is finished it should be painted white and enameled. This will
permit of its being washed every day. A covering of white canton flannel
is made to fit the screen, with the smooth side out, care being taken that
the cover comes to the lower edge of the frame. The wicks are made half
the width of the sides and tacked on the top edge of each side. These
must be long enough to extend 3” over into the water. Strips of
canton flannel 2” wide are tacked all around the sides and the top of
the frame, and the eyes are sewed on these. White tape may be used
for this purpose if more convenient. Sew one row of hooks on the
edge of the covering near the latch and the other just opposite the opening,
with the hem to extend far enough over on each side to cover crack
at the edge of door. This permits the door to be opened without unfastening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the hooks, keeping out the warm outside air and at the same
time retaining the cool air inside the refrigerator. Hook the covering
around the top also. Place the refrigerator in a shady place where the
air will circulate around it freely. Keep the wicks in a supply of fresh
water in the top pan. The water is taken down the sides by capillary attraction,
and when evaporation takes place the heat is taken from the
inside thereby lowering the temperature.</p>

<p>Another type of iceless refrigerator which appears more
crude can be made at a cost of $1.80. In this a cotton sack is
used for the covering. This refrigerator has proved more satisfactory
than one would suppose. The butter and milk from
several cows has been kept in a model of this type at ten degrees
cooler than the outside air. It might be well to use cotton flannel
for the covering instead of ducking because when the cloth is wet
evaporation takes place more rapidly.</p>

The curtain is made of 4 widths of the canton flannel measuring 66” in

<p>A cheap and efficient article for the
housewife is a mop made of old stockings
and the handle of an old, discarded
broom. This mop may be used successfully
for polished and painted floors as
well as for unpolished floors. It is made
by cutting the straw off of a broom
which has worn out. This is cut even
with the wires which hold the straw on
the handle. Cover this part of the
broom with an old stocking, which is
tacked to the handle securely by sewing
it around two or three times with
a double thread. Legs of old stockings
are cut twelve inches long with these
strips cut leaving a band two inches
wide to sew to the covering of the
broom. Sew them round and round
the surface in rows about an inch apart,
until the mop has been made the desired
thickness. Dip the mop into a solution
made of one-half a cupful of melted
paraffin and one cupful of coal oil.
When the mop is not in use, it must
be wrapped up and kept in a paper
bag in order to keep it moist.</p>

and the back porch, where so many flies are attracted by the odor
of the foods, but also excellent for use out of doors. It is inexpensive
and can be easily made at home. Much of the success
of the trap depends upon the bait used. There are many kinds of
baits recommended, such as a plate of vinegar with sugar scattered
around it, banana skins, syrups, and meat. The bait is placed
beneath the cone in a saucer, which rests on the bottom board of
the trap. The flies then enter the cone and are destroyed by smoking
before being removed through the hole in the top. If a
poisonous bait is used the smoking is not necessary.</p>

<p class="unindent">Take one piece (1” × 16” × 16”) and find the center, using a radius of
8” to make a circle for the bottom of the trap. Then use a radius of 6”
to make an opening in the bottom on which the cone fits. An
opening of 1” × 2” is made at some convenient point in the bottom of trap
through which the dead flies are removed. Take a piece of wood
(¼” × 1½” × 2½”) and make a cover to fit over this opening. Fasten
it on the bottom with a screw so that it may be easily turned. Make the
cone of a piece of wire netting 10” wide. It must fit the inside circle
in the bottom as shown in the illustration. Tack this to the bottom with
3-oz. tacks. The top of the trap is made just like the bottom using the
same radius. Cut out 3 places in the top and bottom for the braces
(⅞” × 1” × 24¾”) to fit in. These must extend ¾” below the bottom and
nailed in place with 5-penny box nails. Cover the opening in the top
with a piece of wire netting 13” in diameter. The whole frame is then
covered with the 24” wire netting.</p>

GARBAGE BARREL<br>
</p>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p>The problem of the quickest disposal of the kitchen refuse for
the housekeeper is one of great consideration. The garbage barrel,
as shown in the illustration, is a solution for this problem, in
that it is put between rails with a wheel. The garbage may thus
be rolled away as many times a day as necessary, with a minimum
amount of effort. A covered receptacle promotes sanitation
around the back premises. The size of this convenience varies
with the material available for making the device and with the
size of the family.</p>

WATERWORKS OUTFIT FOR THE HOME<br>
</p>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p>The following illustration shows a simple but cheap arrangement
for a practical water system to be used in the farm home.</p>

<p>A few minutes pumping each morning by the man of the
family will provide a supply of water for the day’s use, or, where
there is no force pump, the water may be brought in pails until
the barrel is filled every day. While not the most satisfactory
plan for putting water into the home, it is far better than having
to carry the water from a pump or often from a spring which is
a long distance from the house. It is a labor- and time-saving
device for the farm woman and enables her to do more efficient
work in every way.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>Pump.</i>: Bore a hole about 2” below the lid of the barrel. This must be
large enough to permit the piece of coupling to fit in it tightly. It is not
necessary to use the coupling but it will give a better support to the hose.
Fasten one end of the hose to the coupling and the other end to the pump.
On the opposite side bore a hole with a ¾” auger and attach the ½” piece

<p class="unindent"><i>Shelf</i>: Raise the barrel to the platform, which is made of 1” boards, and
well braced underneath. This platform is fastened to the house just outside

<p>A portable house placed on runners is shown in the following

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Directions</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="unindent">A good location is the first consideration in the building of a poultry house.
Select a well drained spot, facing the southeast and large enough to make
comfortable quarters for the chickens.</p>

<p class="unindent">The house is built of any kind of durable and well-seasoned lumber. The
kind of material used in making the floor will depend largely on the soil
and the money to be spent in the construction of the house. Board floors
are often used but they are more susceptible to rats. Cement floors are
more easily cleaned and more sanitary, and not so expensive in a locality
where plenty of gravel is available. A board floor must be raised several
inches from the ground as a protection from rats and to allow for runners
to be placed underneath the house.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter break">

 <br>
 <img src="images/i_099.png"
 alt="Poultry house">
 <p class="caption">A portable poultry house, showing the exterior and interior</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<div class="blockquote">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>

<p class="unindent">Roosts are placed on the same level with each other next to the end or back
walls and from 6” to 10” above the dropping boards, which are 2½” from
the floor. Roosts may be stationary as in the cut, or they may be
fastened by hinges to the walls and raised to clean the dropping board.</p>

<p class="unindent">Roost spacing will depend upon the size of the fowls, but a 10” space to
each fowl is usually sufficient. They must be put 15” apart.</p>

<p class="unindent">Nests made 14” square are built under the dropping boards around the
walls of the house as shown in cut. A 4” piece of wood is placed on the
side, which drops as a door in front of the nests.</p>

<p class="unindent">Windows as shown in the cut are more expensive and not as good as a
front made of wood extending about 2’ from the bottom. Wire screening,
admitting better ventilation and more sunlight, is tacked over the
rest of the opening in the front. A curtain may be made of unbleached
muslin and fastened on a pole at the top of the open front, which may be
lowered as a protection in bad weather.</p>

<p class="unindent">Make the roof of some water tight material and cover the walls on the
inside to protect the fowls from draughts.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Nests.</i>—Comfortable and convenient quarters must be furnished
the sitting hen. The location of the nest must be in a
quiet, dark place to keep the hen from becoming restless. A box
fifteen inches square and twelve inches high, with a narrow strip
four to five inches wide at the bottom of the open front of the box,
makes a comfortable nest. Barrels or half-barrels or nests made
of a piece of sod will also be comfortable quarters for the sitting
hen. The nests must be well lined with hay, straw, or excelsior.
Both the nests and the hen must be thoroughly dusted with insect
powder before the sitting time comes.</p>

<p><i>Hatching and Rearing.</i>—There are two methods used in the
hatching and rearing of chickens—the natural, when the chicks
are hatched and reared by a hen, and the artificial, when they are
hatched in incubators and brooded in houses indoors or out-of-doors.
The natural method will be found to be more satisfactory
when dealing with a small number of chickens. A small number
of hens, if managed with system and care, will produce a large
number of chickens at a very small cost.</p>

<p>Care must be taken in the selection of the eggs to be used
for hatching purposes. Select well-formed eggs which are regular
in shape and size and which are neither too large nor too small.
They should come from healthy hens of one breed and should be
smooth and of one color. Eggs must be kept in a dry, cool place
and at a temperature of from fifty to sixty degrees Fahrenheit.
The fertility of an egg weakens with age; so they must be kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
only a few days before they are to be set. The number of eggs
to be put under each hen will vary with the season, the size of the
hen, and the size of the eggs; but it is usually safe to put about
thirteen eggs under a hen of average size.</p>

<p><i>Egg Tester.</i>—Test the eggs in a dark room on the seventh and
fourteenth days for the removal of infertile eggs. This may be
done by a very simple home-made tester made of a pasteboard
or wooden box, with a hole the size of an egg bored in the front,
and an opening in the top through which the smoke is to pass.
If a wooden box with a bottom is used, an opening must be made
in front, with a door so as to put the lamp in. A box without a
bottom may be used and simply set right over the lamp. Either
a lamp, candle, or lantern may be used on the inside of the box.
Holding the egg in front of the box and letting the light shine
through it will show the condition of the egg. An infertile egg
will be clear, while a fertile egg has a spider-like center with
threads leading out from it. All infertile eggs must be removed.</p>

<div class="divcenterimg60">
 <img src="images/i_102.png"
 alt="Egg tester">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Poultry is classified as the egg breeds, the meat breeds, the
general-purpose breeds, and the ornamental breeds.</p>

<p>The egg breeds are small fowls which mature quickly. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
are very active, but not good chickens to be used for setting purposes.
They are good layers, and they lay a great many white-shelled
eggs, for which there is a great demand on some markets.
The age of maturity for this breed is from four and one-half
to five months. The Leghorns and the Minorcas are the principal
representatives of this breed. The single-combed white Leghorn
has been the most popular.</p>

<p>The meat breeds are large fowls with long necks and heavy
coats of feathers; and they lay a comparatively small number of
brown-shelled eggs. They are slow in movement, with little
desire to forage. They make fine mothers, and for this reason
they make good fowls to be used for setting. The Brahmas,
Cochins, and Langshanks are the principal fowls of this breed.</p>

<p>The general-purpose breeds occupy a medium place between
the egg and meat breeds as to size, egg production, and meat production.
For these characteristics they are especially recommended
to the farmer who wishes both egg and meat fowls. They
lay a number of brown-shelled eggs and they make splendid
mothers. The Plymouth Rocks, Wyandottes, Orphingtons, and
Rhode Island Reds are the best varieties of this breed.</p>

<p>The ornamental breeds are ornamental both in character and
purpose, and for this reason they are not practical for use on the
farm.</p>

<p><i>Feeding.</i>—The farmer has often become discouraged by the
elaborate rations which are recommended by poultrymen to be
used in feeding the chickens. While some of the by-products of
industries, such as Linseed Meal and Meat Meal are necessary,
most of the feed used in poultry raising may be raised on the
farm. It is well to be familiar with the different values of foods
fed to the chickens, for they like a change in their rations, and it
is necessary that they have it. If the food contains too much fat,
the hens will become too fat, which will lessen their usefulness as
egg producers; while if the food contains too much protein, some
symptoms of indigestion will result. It is hard to determine the
right amount of fat and protein to be fed to the chickens, for
this varies to suit conditions and the purpose for which it is fed.</p>

<p>Young chicks should be fed a dry or wet feed forty-eight hours
after they are hatched. Nature has already provided them with
yolk of egg, which must be digested before they are given more
food. Their first feed must be fine grit or a drink of sour milk.
In two hours after the first feeding they may be given dry oat
flakes with an egg which has been boiled for an hour, or a Johnny
cake made of ten parts of cornmeal, two parts of wheat middlings,
two parts of wheat bran, mixed with skimmed milk and baked.
Change this diet after a week to a dry ration—for example, two
parts of cracked wheat, two parts of oat flakes, four parts of
cracked corn, one part of rice, and one part of millet. Plenty
of green food and sour milk should be fed to them. Feed them
often, but in small proportions. Let them take plenty of exercise.
It is important to keep the hen up and allow the chicks to run out
until they are weaned.</p>

DRY MASH HOPPER NO. 1<br>
</p>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p>There are many kinds of dry mash hoppers on the market but
it is difficult to find one that is not wasteful. This hopper which
is made of poplar is easily made and it has been found to be very
successful. It may be built of the desired length and made to
hold the required amount of dry mash. The most important
detail in the building of this hopper is the slope of the bottom
which must be at an angle of forty-five degrees with the wall of
the henhouse. It must be built well off the floor with a roost
placed for the hens to stand on while they are feeding. This will
keep the litter out of the hopper. The wire netting must be of
one-quarter inch square mesh which is fastened to the hopper and
stretched to the bottom of the trough at its lowest point.</p>

months to keep the chickens from wallowing in the dirt, as this is
the method used by them to cleanse themselves. A box four feet

top of the jar with a nail and tack two strips of wood across the
top crosswise to raise the jar from the saucer or plate. This
allows the water to flow freely from the jar as fast as the chickens
can drink it from the saucer, and the covered jar keeps the drinking
water clean.</p>

<p class="center">
SHOWING USE OF BUTTER-MAKING EQUIPMENT<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The economic value of farm butter made from the product of
a few cows is of much more importance than is commonly supposed.
For this reason the fundamental principles underlying the
making of good butter should be practised as much by the farm
woman, making butter in small quantities for the market or the
consumption in the home, as by the operator of a large creamery
establishment. The quality of butter made on the average farm
shows that cleanliness and the proper attention to the simplest
details in the making of good butter have been neglected.</p>

<p><i>Quality.</i>—The method used in the handling of milk or cream
and in making butter determines its quality. The sanitation of
the utensils in which cream or milk is handled and the conditions
surrounding it during ripening are of the utmost importance. A
common practice among some farm women is to put the milk in
shallow, uncovered pans which are exposed to dust, flies, and
the odors which frequent the pantry and kitchen. Such pans
are allowed to stand until the milk clabbers and a thick leathery
sheet of cream is formed on the top. Good butter cannot be made
from milk or cream handled in this manner. A deep, narrow
vessel known as a shot-gun can is recommended for use in ripening
cream or milk because it is easily handled, washed and can be
covered. These can be bought at hardware stores or mail order
houses.</p>

<p><i>Utensils.</i>—Convenient equipment for making butter is essential
and very inexpensive. It is customary on many farms to
churn the cream in an earthen jar with a wooden dasher and stick.
Earthenware vessels commonly used are porous and often contain
blisters or air bubbles, all of which will absorb milk. The milk
sours in these places and gives the vessels a characteristic bad
odor. These churns are hard to clean and heavy to handle and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
should never be used. A wooden barrel churn is one of the best
types to use because it is easily operated, cleaned, and handled.
Churns which contain agitators and gearing of different kinds
should not be used.</p>

<p>A dairy thermometer, which can be bought at any local hardware
or drug store at a small cost, is necessary to determine the
temperature of the cream.</p>

<p>When there are at least four cows milked, a small cream
separator will be a good investment. Where a separator cannot
be had, hand skimming is advisable if the cream is properly
handled.</p>

<p><i>Ripening of Cream.</i>—The ripening of milk or cream is the
natural souring which takes place under proper conditions and
which gives butter its characteristic flavor. The quality of butter
depends, to a large extent, upon proper ripening. Where hand
skimming is practised, set separate milkings in cool, well-ventilated
places and allow to stand from twelve to eighteen hours
for the cream to rise. Skim the cream off with a cup or large
spoon, put it into a can which is kept in a cool place at a temperature
of 50 degrees Fahrenheit or below. Skimmings from the
different milkings are cooled to the same temperature before being
added to this stock can. The contents of this can must be stirred
each time after adding the cream. When sufficient cream for a
churning has been secured in this way the contents of the stock
can are warmed to a temperature of 58 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit
and in winter 62 degrees Fahrenheit, then allowed to stand in a
clean, well-ventilated place for twelve or eighteen hours to ripen.
This warming is done by setting the can in a vessel of hot water.
Frequent stirring is necessary during the ripening period. Cream
properly ripened has a velvety and glossy appearance, with a mild
but pleasant sour taste. When hand skimming is not practised
the churning will have to be done more frequently to prevent the
milk from becoming too sour and giving the butter a bad flavor.</p>

<p><i>Coloring the Butter.</i>—The natural color of butter when the
cows can get plenty of nature’s food is a soft, straw yellow.
During the winter, if it is necessary to use dry feed alone, the
butter will lack color which can be supplied by the addition of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
harmless coloring matter. The amount of coloring matter necessary
to use varies with the season but usually 8 to 12 drops of
harmless vegetable coloring to every pound of butter will be
sufficient in the winter time. This coloring matter may be bought
at most drug stores.</p>

<p><i>Churning.</i>—When the cream is ready for churning, rinse the
churn with scalding water to cleanse it thoroughly and to swell
the pores in the wood. Following this, cool the churn with cold
water to prevent the raising of the temperature of the cream
when put into the churn. The cream should be poured through a
strainer into the churn to remove lumps or hard white specks of
cream which may have dried to the sides of the can. Gas will
form in the churn during the first few minutes of churning which
must be let out by removing the cork at the bottom of the churn.
It may be necessary to repeat this operation several times. After
the churn has been in operation about 20 minutes, the cream becomes
thick and shortly after, very small, mealy granules begin
to form. At this point the cream begins to break away from the
glass in the top of the churn lid. When this stage is reached,
after every four or five revolutions the lid should be removed and
the size of the granules observed. When these have reached the
size of large wheat grains, the churning operation has been completed.
At this point the glass in the top appears clear which
indicates that the granules slide off instead of sticking to the top.
It usually takes at least 25 minutes to churn good butter. If it
takes longer, the temperature of the next cream churned should
be raised a few degrees.</p>

<p><i>Washing the Butter.</i>—When churning is completed draw the
buttermilk off through a strainer to catch small particles of butter.
The butter is washed to remove the buttermilk, to improve the
flavor, and to keep better. Buttermilk is washed out of the butter
and not worked out. The temperature of the wash water should
be the same as that of the buttermilk and is determined by the
use of a thermometer. This temperature depends upon the condition
of the butter; if the butter is too soft the water must be
colder, and <i>vice versa</i>. In washing butter, water is added and the
churn given two or three revolutions so as to turn the butter;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
after which the water is drawn off and the process repeated several
times until the water drawn off is clear.</p>

<p><i>Salting the Butter.</i>—The butterworker, paddles, and mold or
printer are scalded and cooled in the same way as the churn and
for the same reasons. The churn is then drawn near the worker
and the butter granules removed with paddle or ladle and placed
on worker. The hands must never touch butter for sanitary
reasons and because they will give the butter a greasy appearance.
As soon as the butter is placed on the worker, one ounce of fine,
clean salt to a pound of butter is sprinkled uniformly over the
butter.</p>

<p><i>Working the Butter.</i>—Butter should then be worked well to
distribute the salt through it and to expel the excess water. Butter
is salted to improve the flavor, to serve the market purposes and
to some degree to act as a preservative. In working the butter,
the pile of granules is pressed flat with the lever, and the flattened
mass of butter turned over about 12 or 14 times until the edges of
butter, when broken, have a granular appearance similar to a
broken half-baked potato. Too much working destroys the grain
and the edges when broken apart will have a slightly stringy
appearance, while too little working gives a streaked or mottled
butter.</p>

<p><i>Printing and Wrapping the Butter.</i>—The printer is removed
from the water as soon as the working has been completed and
with both hands it is pressed on the mass of butter until it is
packed full. That remaining over the edge is then cut off with
a paddle and the print pushed out on a sheet of parchment paper
and neatly wrapped. The printing and wrapping of butter cannot
be emphasized too strongly, for a good appearance is fundamental
to obtaining good markets for the butter. It is very much easier
to get a good market for butter packed neatly in parchment paper
than it is for that wrapped in a cloth as is the case in so many
country homes. It is very important that a good grade of parchment
paper should be used for wrapping butter and this can be
bought from firms handling dairy supplies or it may be ordered
by mail. The brick-shaped mold is used because prints can be
handled with convenience and such prints are a standard on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the market. A mold of this kind can be purchased from local
hardware stores or mail order houses for from $1.50 to $5.00.
The placing of the wrapped print in a pasteboard box or carton
not only protects the butter from the finger prints but also from
dust and dirt. These cartons may be bought from any firm
handling dairy supplies. Butter put up in this manner is
convenient to handle, attractive in appearance, and is also an
advertisement.</p>

<p><i>Marketing the Butter.</i>—The appearance of the package determines
to a large extent the selling price of butter and every effort
should be made to make it as neat, attractive, and convenient
to handle as possible. The ultimate end in the making of farm
butter is to supply a delicate food for the family and to obtain a
profit from the surplus. To do this, it is necessary to create a
demand by giving satisfaction to your customers. This can be
done by putting up butter superior in quality and attractive in
appearance.</p>

CHEESE-MAKING EQUIPMENT<br>
</p>
</div><!--end chapter header-->

<p>Devices used in the process of making cottage, Neufchatel,
and cream cheese are given, accompanied by directions for the use
of each of these devices in the making of these cheeses.</p>

<p><i>Construction of Drainer.</i>—The rack shown in the figure is
13 inches wide, 13 inches long, and 10 inches deep. The corner
posts extend 1½ inches above and below the strips at the top and
bottom with the tops rounded as shown in the illustration. The
bottom slats fit loosely into notches, hence they may be removed
when the draining rack is washed. The materials required are
four corner posts 1½ × 1½ inches; 15 strips 1 × ⅜ × 13 inches
and 2 strips 1 × ⅜ × 13 inches notched to receive the bottom
slats. Pine or poplar may be used for the construction of
this device.</p>

<div class="divcenterimg60">

<p><i>Construction of Press.</i>—3 or 4 inch poplar boards 18 × 18
inches are used for this press. Cleats are placed on the back of
these boards to keep them from warping. The lower board of
this press has a circular groove which has an outlet in one side
to allow the whey to drain off.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
<i>Cottage Cheese.</i>—Cottage cheese has been produced from time
immemorial upon the farm. Ordinarily, it is made from milk
that has been allowed to stand until it thickens by natural souring.
It is then skimmed. After skimming, the rather firm mass of
loppered milk is stirred with a large wooden spoon.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the gentle breaking of the coagulum the
temperature of the mixture of whey and curd is gradually raised to
about 95 degrees Fahrenheit and maintained at that temperature
for five minutes. This mixture should be stirred occasionally but
not vigorously. Too much stirring will cause the mass to drain
slowly. After this heating process the mixture of whey and curd
is poured into the draining cloth; usually muslin or cotton sheeting
is stretched over the draining rack, which is especially constructed
for this purpose. Such a rack as shown in the illustration
can be made very easily and at a small cost. Thirty pounds of
milk per rack may be easily handled. Perhaps, in handling the
milk in this quantity, it would be advisable to make the rack somewhat
longer than the one illustrated. A rack rectangular in
shape, 13 inches wide, 36 inches long and 10 inches deep is sufficient.
The draining mixture is left undisturbed for half an hour
and then the curd is worked toward the center of the cloth by
means of a spoon or ladle. The last of the whey is removed by
raising and lowering repeatedly the ends of the draining cloth.
After draining the curd in this manner the corner of the cloth is
folded over to form a sack and the curd is placed between the
heavy boards or press. If more pressure is needed weights may
be placed on the top board. When the curd has acquired the
consistency desired it is salted to suit the taste, and usually a
small amount of cream is added. The use of the latter, however,
is entirely optional.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the whey by heating hardens the particles of
curd, giving a grainy texture to the mass.</p>

<p><i>Neufchatel Cheese.</i>—Fresh clean milk is required to make a
high-grade Neufchatel cheese. In no case should the milk be over
twelve hours old. A slow development of a clean acid flavor is
demanded. The addition of a commercial lactic starter in small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
amounts aids in obtaining curd free from objectionable ferments.
Too much starter will produce acid too rapidly and give a rough
mealy curd. A very satisfactory product may be secured, if the
milk is reasonably clean, without using any starter.</p>

<p><i>Starter.</i>—The starter is merely soured milk. In making a
home-made starter place a clean milk bottle and tumbler in a pan
of cold water and bring same to boiling; remove the bottle, allow
it to cool and then fill it with the freshest, cleanest milk available.
The bottle should now be covered with a sterilized glass tumbler
in order to prevent the entrance of dirt. Allow the milk to sour at
a temperature of about 75° F. (room temperature).</p>

<p>Two cubic centimeters of active starter for each thirty-pound
can of milk will give good results. After adding the starter the
milk is vigorously stirred and warmed to a temperature of 80° F.
Rennet is now added at the rate of 30 drops per 100 pounds of
milk. Upon a small scale junket tablets may be used for curdling
purposes. The mixture, after being thoroughly stirred, is left at
rest over night at room temperature, or preferably a little higher.
The firm curd is now poured upon the draining rack as with the
cottage cheese and allowed to drain for about two hours. Toward
the end of the draining period the curd is worked toward the center
of the cloth by means of a ladle. The cloths containing the curd
are now tied together bag fashion and pressed. The hand-made
contrivance illustrated may be used, or merely allow weights to
rest on bags of curd over night. The more whey that is removed
the better will be the flavor and keeping qualities of the cheese.
The curd should drain out and not dry out. Mix in the salt to
suit the taste by using a butter worker or a pail and potato masher.
Ordinarily about one ounce of salt to four pounds of curd is sufficient.
The cheese is now ready to be run through the food chopper
and molded. Sometimes it is packed tightly into screw top
jars or jelly glasses with tight covers, but usually the cheese is
molded into shape and wrapped in parchment paper, surrounded
by tin foil to exclude the air. Such molds may be formed by hand
closely enough to exclude the air. Butter printers are often used.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
If the work is done upon a small scale some kind of a hand formed
package is probably most economical.</p>

<p><i>Cream Cheese.</i>—Cream cheese is made in practically the same
way as Neufchatel cheese except that the former is made out of
cream testing from 6 to 8 per cent. fat.</p>

<p>More detailed information on the subject of making cheese
can be obtained from the bulletins and books suggested for reference
reading in the list given in the back of this book.</p>

<b>APPENDIX</b><br>
<br>
FUNDAMENTALS IN WOODWORKING<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Some of the terms used in the text are explained in
this chapter.</p>

<p><i>Tenon.</i>—A tenon is a piece of wood shaped like a tongue by
dividing the end into three rectangular parts, cutting the sides
away and leaving the middle which is shaped to form a tongue.</p>

<p><i>Mortise.</i>—A mortise is a hollow cut in to receive a corresponding
piece of wood. It is made by measuring the required distances
on a piece of wood and boring holes. Take out these portions of
wood with a chisel until the mortise is of the required size.
Mortise and tenon joints put together in one direction, as those
made in the back of a chair, are much easier made than those
which are joined in two directions, as in the framework of a stool.</p>

<p><i>Mitred Joint.</i>—There are many modifications of this joint
but the one most used is the one made at an angle of 45 degrees.
Mitred joints are easily made but they have a tendency to shrink,
leaving an opening on the inside of the joint.</p>

<p><i>Cleat.</i>—A piece of wood nailed down to secure something from
slipping. The size of a cleat will be determined by the weight
which it is to hold.</p>

<p><i>Bevel.</i>—A bevel is a finished edge to a piece of wood. The
kind of problem must determine the kind of beveled edge to be
made. The blade of the square must be set at the correct angle
in making a bevel edge. The most popular bevel is made by
setting the bevel square at an angle of 45 degrees.</p>

<p><i>Bracket or Brace.</i>—A supporting piece for a shelf or any other
place which needs strengthening.</p>

<p><i>Panel.</i>—Any area out of level. It may be sunk below or raised
above the general face of the surrounding work. They are set
in grooves made the proper depth with a plane. Every piece of
wood used in panelling must be straight with the face surface of
the wood and straight and square with the front edge to make
a flat and square panel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
<i>Groove.</i>—A groove is a furrow or a long hollow. The depth
of the furrow depends on the rail it is to hold.</p>

<p><i>Taper.</i>—A taper is a graduated point. All parts of the surface
must have the same amount of taper to make it equally tight
at all points when driven into place. Draw lines on the end of the
wood and across the center at equal distances from the corners
and with the surface straight on both sides. Care must be taken
not to split the corners while making a taper.</p>

<p><i>Plugs.</i>—Plugs are pieces of tapered wood used as a stopper,
such as in the illustration of Jelly Strainer <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2. When plugs
are to be used, the holes must be made in the wood before the
pieces are put together.</p>

<p>“<i>Penny.</i>”—This term is a corruption of “pound” and used
in speaking of different kinds of nails. For example, eight-penny
nails means that one thousand of them weigh eight pounds.</p>

<p><i>Radius Bar.</i>—A bar pivoted at one end, about which it swings,
and having its other end attached to a piece which it causes to
move in a circular arc as in the corrugated roller made to work
the butter.</p>

<p><i>Finishing.</i>—There are two things to be considered in finishing
woodwork; the preservation of the wood, and the artistic finish.
Three steps are necessary in putting on the finishing touches.
First, the surfaces made smooth by the use of sandpaper; the
second, staining or varnishing, and the third, polishing.</p>

<p><i>Sandpaper.</i>—Sandpaper is not expected to do the work of
edged tools. Tool work must be completed before using sandpaper,
or particles of dust will get into the pores of the wood
which will dull the tools while working with them. Never sandpaper
across the grain of the wood. While dressing flat surfaces,
use a piece of sandpaper put over a block of wood.</p>

<p><i>Stains.</i>—Water, oil, and alcoholic stains are used for staining
woodwork. All have their advantages and disadvantages, but
for general purposes the alcoholic stains are highly recommended,
Johnson’s wood dye being one of the best. A good water stain
is made by boiling an extract of logwood, the size of a walnut,
with four ounces of water. This is applied to the wood while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
hot, using a brush or sponge with which to apply it. Repeat the
application until the desired color is obtained. Varnish must be
used only when a hard, transparent finish is desired.</p>

<p><i>Polish or Wax.</i>—Satisfactory results cannot be obtained
unless the surface is smooth and well prepared by the use of sandpaper
and stain. A cheap recipe for making wax is given as
follows:</p>

<ul class="small">
<li>1 lb. beeswax.</li>
<li>½ pt. alcohol.</li>
<li>1 pt. turpentine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Break up the beeswax and melt it into the consistency of
thick cream in a bowl placed in a saucepan of boiling water.
Remove bowl from the fire, gradually beating into the wax the
turpentine and alcohol. Store it away in covered jars and warm
slightly when it is to be used. Spread a thin layer on a soft
woollen cloth and apply it to the surface.</p>
